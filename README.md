# Android Pluggable Transports Dispatch Service

This project is for implementing and providing access to transports compliant with the Pluggable Transports 2.x specification to any Android app that wishes to utilize them. It is built from knowledge and code initially developed through the work on Orbot (Tor for Android) use of Pluggable Transports, VPN features, and inter-application APIs (NetCipher). This project also will utilize the Operator Foundation's Shapeshifter-Transports library in order to provide access to common pluggable transports implemented in Go.
